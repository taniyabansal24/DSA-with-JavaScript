# DSA with JavaScript: Daily Practice Repository

Welcome to my **DSA with JavaScript** GitHub repository! This repo is dedicated to my daily learning and practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using JavaScript.

## About This Repository
This repository contains solutions to DSA questions that I solve daily while learning from the **Pepcoding DSA Level 1** YouTube playlist. The playlist primarily uses Java for explanations and code, but I am adapting the concepts and solving the problems using JavaScript.

### Playlist Source
- **Pepcoding DSA Level 1**: [View Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Jc9J83PIiFj7YSPl2ulcpwy-mwj1SSk&si=MEhFgn2Aw_V57ZvB)

The playlist covers both theoretical concepts and practical questions, which I will implement and organize here.

- **Topic-wise Folders**: Solutions are categorized based on topics like Functions, Arrays, etc.
- **Resources**: Includes important notes and references.
- **README.md**: This main README file.

## Goals
1. Develop a strong foundation in DSA concepts.
2. Improve problem-solving skills using JavaScript.
3. Adapt Java-based DSA explanations to JavaScript implementations.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-with-JavaScript.git
  ```
- Navigate to the relevant topic's folder for specific problem solutions.
- Run the JavaScript files using Node.js:
  ```bash
